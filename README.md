# 1874 Baptismal Vows

<img src="28 Fundamentals.PNG">

"Our research indicates that Baptismal Vows were officially introduced to God's Church in 1874. Nevertheless there is evidence from Sister White's writings that vows were in vogue at least in 1872 (see later). We cite those 1874 vows:"
...

**[13]** Will you seek to build up the interests of the church by ***giving the Sabbath School your hearty and practical support*** and attending, as far as possible, all services of the church? And will you endeavour by God's help to do your part in
the work of the church? Luke 4:16; Rom. 12:4-8.

We thank God that our Sabbath schools have contributed enough to advance many a precious enterprise. Children and youth have given their pennies, that, like little rivulets, have supplied a stream of beneficence. Children should be educated in such a way that they may perform unselfish acts which heaven will rejoice to see. When the dew of youth is upon them, children should be trained how to do service for Christ. They should be taught self-denial.--TSS 113.  {CSW 129.1}

<summary><strong>Working for the Youth</strong></summary>  

We would also ask if some line of work cannot be devised by which our children and young people will have something to draw their interest from worldly pleasures to those that will purify, and ennoble the mind, and train them for workers in God's cause. The young must have something to occupy the thoughts, and if good is not provided, evil will take its place. We know of some who are looking to this meeting for a solution of the problem, and are anxiously longing for help in this direction. {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 100.8}

Another secretary says, "This subject of helping our young people is one I have longed to get some help on. So many of our Sabbath-school scholars are bright, full of life, and if something could be done to get their minds turned in the line of missionary work, it would be a blessing both to the young and the cause. <u>**Many about the age of fifteen are losing their interest and going in the ways of the world**</u>, and I would be glad if something could be done for them. I believe greater care should be taken in the selection of teachers. What we most need is laborers to work in this branch of the cause of God. It seems we are almost destitute of workers."   {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 99.2}


"In years past our special efforts have been for the primary department; but since camp-meeting we have concentrated all our forces, or at least a few of us have, for the conversion of the youth. We saw that many were drifting and unless we held them now, in another year they might be lost to us forever. Then too, they will soonest develop into laborers of any class. We thought the wee ones were not in such immediate danger. We have told the schools to put their strongest force at this point; to select the very best and most consecrated teachers for the youth's class." {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 100.5}


Still another writes in much the same way, and says: "Only about two-fifths of our church-members are members of the Sabbath-school. What can be done to impress them with the importance of the work? Only the Spirit of the Lord is able to do this. There are so many that do not attend the Sabbath-school, that have children, and I fear that many times home influences tend to drive them from the truth rather than draw them near. The president of our association, I believe, is faithful in this work as far as he has time; but so many other duties are placed upon him, he has little time left to devote to Sabbath-school work.   {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 99.5}

<summary><strong>Personal Work in the Sabbath School</strong></summary> 

There should be much personal work done in the Sabbath school. The necessity of this kind of work is not recognized and appreciated as it should be. From a heart filled with gratitude for the love of God, which has been imparted to the soul, <u>the teacher should labor tenderly and earnestly for the conversion of his scholars</u>.  {CSW 61.2}
