# 1874 Baptismal Vows

<img src="img/28 Fundamentals.PNG">

"Our research indicates that Baptismal Vows were officially introduced to God's Church in 1874. Nevertheless there is evidence from Sister White's writings that vows were in vogue at least in 1872 (see later). We cite those 1874 vows:"
...

**[13]** Will you seek to build up the interests of the church by ***giving the Sabbath School your hearty and practical support*** and attending, as far as possible, all services of the church? And will you endeavour by God's help to do your part in
the work of the church? Luke 4:16; Rom. 12:4-8.

<strong>Offerings</strong>
</summary> 

We thank God that our Sabbath schools have contributed enough to advance many a precious enterprise. Children and youth have given their pennies, that, like little rivulets, have supplied a stream of beneficence. Children should be educated in such a way that they may perform unselfish acts which heaven will rejoice to see. When the dew of youth is upon them, children should be trained how to do service for Christ. They should be taught self-denial.--TSS 113.  {CSW 129.1}

<summary><strong>Personal Work in the Sabbath School</strong></summary> 

There should be much personal work done in the Sabbath school. The necessity of this kind of work is not recognized and appreciated as it should be. From a heart filled with gratitude for the love of God, which has been imparted to the soul, <u>the teacher should labor tenderly and earnestly for the conversion of his scholars</u>.  {CSW 61.2}
