# 1874 Baptismal Vows

<img src="28 Fundamentals.PNG">

"Our research indicates that Baptismal Vows were officially introduced to God's Church in 1874. Nevertheless there is evidence from Sister White's writings that vows were in vogue at least in 1872 (see later). We cite those 1874 vows:"
...

**[13]** Will you seek to build up the interests of the church by ***giving the Sabbath School your hearty and practical support*** and attending, as far as possible, all services of the church? And will you endeavour by God's help to do your part in
the work of the church? Luke 4:16; Rom. 12:4-8.

<strong>Offerings</strong>
</summary> 

We thank God that our Sabbath schools have contributed enough to advance many a precious enterprise. Children and youth have given their pennies, that, like little rivulets, have supplied a stream of beneficence. Children should be educated in such a way that they may perform unselfish acts which heaven will rejoice to see. When the dew of youth is upon them, children should be trained how to do service for Christ. They should be taught self-denial.--TSS 113.  {CSW 129.1}


In harmony with the resolution passed requesting the Sabbath-schools to ***make the mission fields to which their offerings are given a study***, we have sent out from the International office over 7,000 circular letters on different subjects to the schools, and others have been forwarded to the State secretaries and sent to the schools by them. The Sabbath-School Worker has had a department devoted to the consideration of the field to which the offerings were given, and this has tended, we think, to increase the interest felt in these fields.  {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 306.8}

A resolution was also passed at our last meeting asking state officers to put forth ***greater efforts to circulate the Sabbath-School Worker***. Elder Durland has told you of the increased patronage given the journal. For its prosperity we are indebted to the state officers who have so heartily seconded our efforts to place it in their schools. We trust their interests may still continue, resulting in placing the Worker on a paying basis.  {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 306.7}

In most conferences the State secretaries are remunerated for their services from the Conference funds according to the resolution recommending that this should be done. There are three associations where ***the secretary is paid from funds raised by the schools for the support of foreign missions***. We trust these secretaries may soon be recognized as conference laborers as is done in other associations. {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 306.10}

The officers of the International Association feel a deep interest in the canvassing work and in ministerial labor. We could wish that hundreds more were engaged in these lines of work. At the same time we have not known how the work which was needed in our Sabbath-schools was to be accomplished. ***One person at least is needed in each of our larger conferences to visit from school to school, assisting each in their work***, laboring for the young, awakening greater interest in Bible study and showing how to study it, and organizing and assisting in mothers' and children's meetings. Such workers would find a wide field of usefulness, and would fill a useful place in any Conference.  {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 307.1}

Elder Chadwick furnished us with quite a number of addresses of individuals, while on his way through the West India Islands and South America, and aided us much in gaining a better understanding of the work in those countries. ***Quite a number were found unable to supply themselves with the things necessary to start a Sabbath-school, and the International Association has sent lesson pamphlets, periodicals, and other supplies to those and other destitute fields***. Through the kindness of Captain Foreman we were able to do the same for our brethren on Pitcairn Island, and another supply was sent a few weeks ago by our missionary ship Pitcairn. In the replies received from all these fields we learn that our letters are gladly received and the literature is used with profit. Several small schools have been organized, ***and isolated persons are studying the Bible with new interest***.  {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 307.3}


Having learned of ***a few Sabbath-keepers in Oklahoma and Indian Territory*** we entered into correspondence with them. ***Some were in destitute circumstances and needed help. Record books, lesson papers, and pamphlets were sent.*** Elder Durland has already stated that an association was formed there last October, of about sixty members. {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 307.4}

<summary><strong>Working for the Youth</strong></summary>  

We would also ask if some line of work cannot be devised by which our children and young people will have something to draw their interest from worldly pleasures to those that will purify, and ennoble the mind, and train them for workers in God's cause. The young must have something to occupy the thoughts, and if good is not provided, evil will take its place. We know of some who are looking to this meeting for a solution of the problem, and are anxiously longing for help in this direction. {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 100.8}


Another secretary says, "This subject of helping our young people is one I have longed to get some help on. So many of our Sabbath-school scholars are bright, full of life, and if something could be done to get their minds turned in the line of missionary work, it would be a blessing both to the young and the cause. <u>**Many about the age of fifteen are losing their interest and going in the ways of the world**</u>, and I would be glad if something could be done for them. I believe greater care should be taken in the selection of teachers. What we most need is laborers to work in this branch of the cause of God. It seems we are almost destitute of workers."   {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 99.2}


"In years past our special efforts have been for the primary department; but since camp-meeting we have concentrated all our forces, or at least a few of us have, for the conversion of the youth. We saw that many were drifting and unless we held them now, in another year they might be lost to us forever. Then too, they will soonest develop into laborers of any class. We thought the wee ones were not in such immediate danger. We have told the schools to put their strongest force at this point; to select the very best and most consecrated teachers for the youth's class." {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 100.5}


Still another writes in much the same way, and says: "Only about two-fifths of our church-members are members of the Sabbath-school. What can be done to impress them with the importance of the work? Only the Spirit of the Lord is able to do this. There are so many that do not attend the Sabbath-school, that have children, and I fear that many times home influences tend to drive them from the truth rather than draw them near. The president of our association, I believe, is faithful in this work as far as he has time; but so many other duties are placed upon him, he has little time left to devote to Sabbath-school work.   {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 99.5}

<summary><strong>Work of the Secretaries
</strong></summary>  
It may seem to some that the work of the secretary is simply to write, and that it does not require much wisdom or help from God to do efficient work. The experience of one secretary may be of interest. She writes: "You ask me to tell you how I obtained success in my work. I hardly know how to answer it. I just wrote letters, and asked God to teach me what to write, and the Lord did the rest. The schools were organized and prospered almost before I knew it, and the work seemed so easily done. It certainly has not been accomplished by any of my wisdom; for I have learned never to write a letter without asking for wisdom to write it. {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 100.2} 


-
"Once in awhile I used to do it, - spend much time and thought, and think that was just the right kind of letter for that particular case. Then I'd think, Now I'll pray the Lord to bless it, and would lay it before him and ask for his blessing. More than once I have risen from my knees, torn up the letter and wrote one entirely different, - perhaps write things I had never before thought of writing, when God had enlightened my understanding. We had about thirteen schools at the beginning of last year and about fifty at its close. {March 13, 1891 N/A, GCDB 100.3}

					This would seem like making calls


It is true this is not always the most encouraging kind of work for the Secretary. Her letters often remain unanswered, and she is puzzled to know how to reach those she longs to help. One secretary scornfully inquires, "What shall I do for my naughty child?" as she terms her state school. But because the child is "naughty" it must not therefore be left to itself. The prayers offered, the letters written, will be as the silent seed sinking into the earth to bring forth fruit after many days.  {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 306.6}

<summary><strong>Personal Work in the Sabbath School</strong></summary> 

There should be much personal work done in the Sabbath school. The necessity of this kind of work is not recognized and appreciated as it should be. From a heart filled with gratitude for the love of God, which has been imparted to the soul, <u>the teacher should labor tenderly and earnestly for the conversion of his scholars</u>.  {CSW 61.2}

<summary><strong>Seeking Isolated Members</strong></summary>  

Looking backward to the last meeting of the International Association held two years ago we find several resolutions providing for different lines of work. It may be of interest to-day to know how these have been carried out. First, we call attention to one recommending that each association organize a state school and ***put forth earnest efforts to secure the enrollment of every isolated Sabbath-keeper***. In December, 1891 there were nineteen of these organizations. At the present time there are eighteen. Sept. 30, 1890 there were but five state schools with a total membership of seventy-five, and donations to missions for the quarter ending at that time amounting to $32.53. Sept. 30, 1892 140 members were reported. Seven associations that sent donations from the state school did not report the number of members so the above number does not correctly represent the membership at that time. The donations for that quarter amounted to $120.44. From Sept. 30, 1890 to Sept. 30, 1892 the donations from these state schools to missions amounted to $523.43. The one in South Africa, with but eight members sent $9.75 last quarter to the Secretary for missions. {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 306.4}

But the money received from these isolated individuals is the least benefit derived from the state school. ***As the result of the kindly, encouraging letters sent them by the Secretary these isolated individuals are brought in touch with the work, and they feel that some Christian heart cares for them***. They are encouraged to press on, they engage with new interest in Bible study, and often a family or regular Sabbath-school is organized from such a small beginning.  {February 20, 1893 N/A, GCDB 306.5}
